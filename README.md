# Project Name: Lapis

## Project Description

Lapis is a web application developed during my internship at Learn Basics Company. Our main objective was to create a user-friendly platform that aligns with the current and previous year's academic curriculum. Lapis focused on the following key objectives:

- **Curriculum Alignment:** We aimed to match the test syllabus with the curriculum students were studying. This ensured that the questions in the tests directly related to the basic concepts taught in their courses.

- **Guided Workbooks:** We designed customized workbooks for Math and Science. These workbooks were designed to assist both slow and fast learners by providing structured guidance over a limited period.

- **Creative Question Framing:** Our creative team crafted questions that gradually challenged students' creativity and problem-solving abilities. Questions were organized to encourage students to approach problems differently.

## Our Contribution

During the development of Lapis, I worked with my teammate, Nagaraja, as front-end developers. Our responsibilities included creating various web pages for the application, each with a specific purpose:

- **Student Data:** This page allowed for the management and display of student information.

- **School Data:** School-related data was organized and presented on this page.

- **Lapis Exam Info:** This page contained detailed information about the Lapis exams, including schedules.

- **Lapis OMR Response:** It handled and displayed the Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) responses from students.

- **Lapis Answer Key:** This section facilitated the management of answer keys for the exams.

- **Lapis Hall Ticket:** Users could generate and manage hall tickets for the exams here.

- **Lapis Concept ID:** This page was used for identifying and categorizing different concepts for the exams.

- **Lapis Report Generation:** Here, reports related to student performance and other relevant data were generated.

- **Lapis Worksheet Generation:** This page allowed for the creation and distribution of worksheets.

## Additional Responsibilities

In addition to our front-end development work, I also contributed to the back-end aspects of Lapis. Specifically, I was involved in report and worksheet generation using LaTeX. We utilized PyLaTeX, a Python library for creating and manipulating LaTeX files, to generate these documents.

Furthermore, we integrated Lapis with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data efficiently. This integration enabled us to dynamically generate worksheets for each student based on their performance data stored in the database. This approach ensured that the worksheets were tailored to each student's needs and progress.

Lapis was created with the intention of simplifying the learning process and helping students understand fundamental concepts better. Our contributions as front-end developers, along with the utilization of LaTeX and PostgreSQL for report and worksheet generation, aimed to enhance the overall educational experience for students.
